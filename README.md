# Random Story

a simple SPA just for fun

-   HTML, CSS, JS
-   each click generates a short story of several lines, with randomised characters, names and words.
-   a matching background photo is generated using the `Flickr API` and a relevant background colour is also applied

(a py version was first created as an experiment)
